# Section 7 Notes
## App Overview
### Things to Still Figure out
- How do we get feedback from the user?
- How do we fetch data from some outside API or server?
- How do we show lists of records?

### Common Event Handlers
- onClick
    - user clicks on something
- onChange
    - User changes text in an input
- onSubmit
    - User submits a form

### Event Handler Callback method naming convention
- onInputClick - `on[ElementName][Action]` - `on` could be `handle`
