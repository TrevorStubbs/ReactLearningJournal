## Class-Based Components
- Functional - Can produce JSX to show content to the user
- Class based 
    - Can use the Lifecycle Method system to run code at specific points in time
    - can use the 'state' system to update content on the screen.

- Hooks System - allows function components to have the 'same' capabilities of class components

- Learning steps
    - Class Components

- Functional Component Lifecycle:
    - JS file loaded by browser
    - App component gets created
    - We call geolocation service - This takes time        
    - App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML
    - We get result of geolocation

- JavaScript Classes    
    - Inheritance works on prototypical inheritance

- Rules of Class Components
    - Must be a JavaScript Class
    - Must extend (subclass) React.Component
    - Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX
